                  <p className="text-dark-1 mt-20">
                    Our journey began with a shared passion for cybersecurity
                    and a desire to empower students at New Era University. We
                    recognized the growing need for skilled cybersecurity
                    professionals and understood that hands-on experience was
                    key to mastering the complexities of this field. That&apos;s
                    why we founded PWNEUâ€”to create a platform where students can
                    learn, grow, and challenge themselves through Capture The
                    Flag (CTF) competitions and other interactive learning
                    experiences. Our story is one of innovation, community, and
                    a commitment to nurturing the next generation of
                    cybersecurity experts.
